 IEEE DTU Student Branch, established in 1983, in the IEEE Delhi Section, Region 10, is the oldest and largest society at Delhi Technological University. With a history of over four decades, it has grown into one of the most vibrant and innovative student organizations on campus, dedicated to promoting technical knowledge, skill development, and leadership among students.
Under the guidance of Dr. J. Panda, IEEE DTU organizes numerous events throughout the year, engaging students with cutting-edge technology and fostering collaboration. The academic year begins with an Orientation Program for juniors, followed by IEEE Day on October 1st, setting the tone for a series of major events like Tech Week, TROIKA, and Vihaan, which is India’s largest student-run hackathon, throughout the year. These events offer students a chance to learn, innovate, and grow through hands-on experience.
IEEE DTU is supported by four specialized chapters—Computer Society (CS), Women in Engineering (WIE), Power & Energy Society – Industrial Applications Society (PES-IAS), and Circuits and Systems Society (CASS). Each chapter plays a vital role in managing and organizing events related to its domain, ensuring a seamless experience while promoting in-depth technical learning.
In addition to events, IEEE DTU is well-known for its publications, such as ECHO, IOTA, TRIGGER, and The Troika Times, which offer students a platform to showcase their technical knowledge and document the branch’s activities.
IEEE DTU also provides a robust mentoring system, where students can interact with seniors and alumni placed at top companies like Microsoft and Google, gaining insights and guidance for their future careers. As the oldest and largest society at DTU, IEEE DTU remains committed to fostering innovation, leadership, and personal growth, equipping its members with the skills and knowledge to make a lasting impact in the tech world.
